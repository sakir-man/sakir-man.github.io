This course serves as an introductory preparation for practical training at the Office of Religious Affairs (KUA) and the Religious Court (PA). The KUA is responsible for marriage administration, including the registration and recording of marriages, issuing marriage recommendation letters, receiving and correcting marital data, and providing certificates of marital status. The Religious Court (PA) holds broader authority, handling various matters such as marriage cases (including polygamy permits, marriage prevention, refusal and annulment, negligence claims, divorce, and joint property settlement) as well as issues related to inheritance, wills, grants, waqf, zakat, infaq, sadaqah, and Islamic economic disputes.
