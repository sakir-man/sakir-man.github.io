## Research Focus

I am a researcher in Islamic astronomy specializing in the legal and cosmological aspects of lunar observation and Islamic calendar systems. My work integrates Islamic legal theory (fiqh), astronomy (‘ilm al-falak), and scientific methodology to understand the dynamics of moon sighting, hilal visibility criteria, and their implications for Islamic timekeeping.

Below are selected research themes and projects.
