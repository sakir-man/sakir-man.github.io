## Research Roadmap: Crescent Visibility & Islamic Astronomy

This roadmap outlines the key stages and thematic directions for investigating crescent visibility (hilal), integrating astronomical, atmospheric, computational, and jurisprudential perspectives.

### 1. Fundamental Study — Astronomical Basis
- Geometric analysis of Moon–Earth–Sun relationships  
- Core visibility parameters (elongation, altitude, illumination)  
- Classical vs modern visibility models

### 2. Atmospheric & Environmental Impact
- Twilight scattering effects  
- Sky brightness and tropical atmospheric behaviors  
- Meteorological influences on visibility

### 3. Observational Astronomy & Fieldwork
- Standardized observational protocols  
- Training DSLR & CCD imaging techniques  
- Citizen science observational networks

### 4. Hisab, Computational Modeling & Simulation
- Numerical hisab models  
- Visibility simulations & POD mapping  
- Case studies of predicted vs observed outcomes

### 5. Integration of Hisab–Rukyat for Calendar System
- Criteria harmonization  
- Integrated calendar frameworks  
- Dialogue with stakeholders

### 6. Jurisprudential (Fiqh) Implications
- Fiqh analysis of visibility data  
- Legal frameworks for month determination  
- Consensus study among scholars

### 7. Community Engagement & Capacity Building
- Training workshops  
- Public outreach  
- Reporting platforms

### 8. Tools & Technology Development
- Mobile & web applications  
- Automatic sensors & reporting tools  
- Open-source software

### 9. Evaluation & Policy Impact
- Impact assessment  
- Policy briefs  
- Implementation feedback

### 10. Future Directions
- AI assisted detection  
- Global visibility standards  
- Multi-disciplinary integrative research
